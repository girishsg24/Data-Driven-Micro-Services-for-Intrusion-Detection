## ClickOS
Over the years middleboxes have become a fundamental part of todayâ€™s networks. Despite their usefulness, 
they come with a number of problems, many of which arise from the fact that they are hardware-based: they are costly,
difficult to manage, and their functionality is hard or impossible to change, to name a few. To address these issues,
there is a recent trend towards network function virtualization (NFV), in essence proposing to turn these middleboxes into software-based,
virtualized entities. Towards this goal we introduce ClickOS, a high-performance, virtualized software middlebox platform. 
ClickOS virtual machines are small (5MB), boot quickly (about 30 milliseconds), add little delay (45 microseconds) and over one hundred of them can be concurrently run while saturating a 10Gb pipe on a commodity server.
We further implement a wide range of middleboxes including a firewall, a carrier-grade NAT and a load balancer and show that ClickOS can handle packets in the millions per second.

This repository contains the useful scripts for setting up ClickOS test bed in CloudLab. 
This scripts have been tested under Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

===============================================================================
To build the assets, run following commands: 
   
    1) ./setup.basic.sh     # Initialize the environment for next steps.
        (chmod u+x setup.basic.sh if permission denied error)
    
    2) ./install.xen.sh     # Install Xen into this machine and make current OS as Dom0. 
                            # Reboot is required! This step may exit with no-zero (this case,
                            # you may need to install some dependencies that are required by Xen.)
        (chmod u+x install.xen.sh if permission denied error)
        
    3) Grub Step
       sudo grep "menuentry '" /boot/grub/grub.cfg |less -N 
                        # lists all the available images and their number
                        # select the one with xen keyword and use this to update grub file
       edit /etc/default/grub
                        #edit grub default with the (number you found earlier - 1)
                        #Add the below line at the end:
                        GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN="dom0_mem=1024M,max:1024M dom0_max_vcpus=2"

        update-grub
        reboot
       
    4) ./install.clickos.sh # After rebooting, run this script to install clickos. 
        (chmod u+x install.clickos.sh if permission denied error)

    5) ./install.ovs.sh     # Install Open Vswitch. ClickOS needs this. 
        (chmod u+x install.ovs.sh if permission denied error)

    After the four steps, the whole testbed is set up. 
    Then you may need to add some bridges or ports to ovs to support clickos.
